							<b><h2>Edwin Gumba Jr.</h2></b><br>
							Hola, I'm Edwin Gumba. My friends call me Eddie, while I proclaim the nickname "Edwonton" since I love noodles. I used to 
							study at Integrated Montessori Center with multiple honor awards. I'm currently a STEM student specializing in IT at Asia 
							Pacific College. I'm a marketing officer in the Junior Philippine Computer Science club since notifying people about tech 
							seems pretty cool. I chose this strand because I saw this as something aligned with what I want to learn, programming. Java, 
							HTML, CSS, Python, C++, and a bit of JSP are the languages that I pursue. Overall, I'm still a beginner in programming software, 
							games, and sites. I'm willing to learn, and I would like to emphasize each journey's step. <br><br>
